                            <p>"I took a group of 10 students with me to Beijing, China. It was an amazing experience
                                the students all loved it and want to go back next year. I had a great experience from
                                beginning to end that was well coordinated and cost efficient through Volunteering
                                Solutions. I couldn't be happier with my overall experience. The Program coordinator
                                made sure we had a good balance of volunteer and personal time. She knew better than we
                                did actually what we were going to be able to handle or not handle and was extremely
                                helpful. We stayed in the hostel and they did an amazing job with our food - they made
                                sure that it wasn't the same thing every day. it was well organized and they were really
                                thoughtful. The staff was very helpful with helping to make sure we had what we needed
                                from doing laundry to getting us a birthday cake to helping us figure out the subway.
                                The orphanage was really great. We enjoyed ourselves and the school was great too. The
                                experience got my students to speak Chinese quickly."</p>
